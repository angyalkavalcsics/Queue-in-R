Currently this package supports performance analysis for G/G/1, M/M/1, M/M/c, Erlang loss, Finite Population Single-Server, Open Jackson Networks, Closed Jackson Networks. 
Additionally, there are some helper funtions such as the one for Birth/Death models or for solving a routing matrix. 

Working on a demo for finding average service time, average arrival rate, and other metrics needed for these models.
